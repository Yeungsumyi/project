      Photography has undoubtedly been transformed by digital cameras. In 1975, Kodak stunned the world by debuting the first digital camera. Weighing around 3.6kg, it took 23 seconds to take a low-resolution picture. Just imagine your entire family posing and smiling for such an extended period of time, it must have been a difficult job.

      Fast forward to today, and thanks to advanced technology, cameras have significantly improved in terms of speed, resolution, low-light performance, connectivity, and other areas. Digital cameras are essential in many fields these days, especially for journalists who depend on them to take high-resolution images in real-time so stories can be reported quickly, scientists who capture objects in astronomy and record seconds or days of details for their studies.
